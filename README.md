# Useful R techniques

I will introduce how to analyze, summarize, visualize RNA-Seq data using R and its packages including edgeR, tidyverse, data.table, etc.
For enrichment analysis of RNA-Seq, we normally use [Metascape](https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1).
In this repository, only a method using Metascape data for RNA-Seq analysis will be introduced. 
I will also introduce how to process Metascape enrichment results and visualize qPCR validation results using Python.

â€» All example data showed in this section are all modified data, not our original data.
